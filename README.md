## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeEnthusiast09/nft-marketplace.git
cd nft-marketplace
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys inside. The WalletConnect project ID is now required since the v2 update. You can create one easily on the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com):

```env
# The Graph Subgraph URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL=https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<your-id>/nft-marketplace/v0.0.1

# Smart Contract Addresses (Sepolia Testnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID = "Project ID needed for WalletConnect v2 here";
```

**How to get your Subgraph URL:**

1. Go to [The Graph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/)
2. Deploy your subgraph (see [Subgraph Setup](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/developing/deploying/using-subgraph-studio/))
3. Copy the "Query URL" from your dashboard

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your marketplace!
